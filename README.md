Javascript Utilities framework

This is a simple javascript utilities framework where I add common methods that I find useful during development. This is a living thing, so it might change completely from one day to another. Also, I keep doing changes and improvements, so this is considered an eternal beta.

It uses a variation of the revealing module pattern.

Make comments if you want to, all ideas are welcome.
